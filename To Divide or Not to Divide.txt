									To Divide or Not to Divide


Alice likes all the numbers which are divisible by A. Bob does not like the numbers which are divisible by B and likes all the remaining numbers. Determine the smallest number greater than or equal to N which is liked by both Alice and Bob. Output −1 if no such number exists.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers A, B and N — the parameters mentioned in the problem statment.
Output Format
For each test case, output the smallest number ≥ N which is divisible by A and is not divisible by B. Output −1 if no such number exists.
